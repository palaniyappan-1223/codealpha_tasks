
Title: Compound Gear Assembly – SolidWorks Model

Description:
This model represents a compound gear assembly designed for mechanical power transmission systems. It consists of two gears mounted concentrically on the same shaft:

Primary Gear (Large Gear): Used to transmit torque and reduce rotational speed.
Secondary Gear (Small Gear): Provides a compact solution for multi-stage gear reduction.

The design ensures smooth meshing, optimized tooth profile, and high efficiency for applications requiring speed reduction and torque amplification.

Technical Details:
Gear Type: Spur gears (straight teeth for simplicity and efficiency)
Configuration: Compound gear (two gears fixed together on the same axis)

Applications:
Gearboxes
Automation systems
Mechanical drives
Robotics and industrial machinery

Advantages:
Compact design for multi-stage reduction
High load capacity
Easy to manufacture and assemble

Design Features:
Accurate involute tooth profile for minimal friction and noise
Central bore for shaft mounting
Compatible with standard gear ratios
Material can be adapted for steel, aluminum, or polymer depending on application
